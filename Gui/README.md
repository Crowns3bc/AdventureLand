Party Frames is a customizable visual window that displays party member stats. You can configure it to show various information according to your preferences.
- If you’re in an iframe, only the leader needs to run the code for everyone’s info to show.
- If you’re not in an iframe, you’ll only see party info for members who are nearby or running the code themselves.
- If both you and a party member run the code, their info always shows, no matter where they are.
